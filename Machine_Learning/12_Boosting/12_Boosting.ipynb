    "**Boosting** is an ensemble modeling technique which attempts to build a strong classifier from the number of weak classifiers. It is done by building a model using weak models in series. First, a model is built from the training data. Then the second model is built which tries to correct the errors present in the first model. This procedure is continued and models are added until either the complete training data set is predicted correctly or the maximum number of models are added.\n",
